# Real-Time Face, Body, and Age Detection with OpenCV

This project uses OpenCV and a deep learning model to perform real-time face, body, and age detection from a live webcam feed. The program detects faces and bodies using pre-trained Haar Cascade classifiers and estimates the age range of detected faces using a deep learning model.


## Features

- Real-time detection of faces and full bodies from a webcam feed.
- Age prediction for detected faces using a deep learning model with various age ranges.
- Simple interface to quit the program by pressing `q`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy

You can install the required Python packages using:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
